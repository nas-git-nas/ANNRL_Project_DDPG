## Report
* Miniproject_DDPG.pdf is the project description.

## Code
* Select the desired algorithm and execute it with _run.py_. All figures, the loss data and the models are saved in the _results_ directory.
* The Jupyter notebook _Code_DDPG_BobrovskiyDaniil_SchmidNicolaj.ipynb_ summarizes all algorithms in one file.
